BUGs:

closing '}' after a THEN block appear in the _following_ BASIC line.

warnings about block ender tokens not matching the block starter appear even
in modes without indentation.

the "asis" mode complains about NEXTs because they do not match the "indentation"


TODOs:

keep :REMs at end of line at end of line

change GOTO <nothing> to GOTO 0

change "." numbers to "0"

allow NEXT to close several blocks, if there are given more vars

actually _check_ var names given after NEXT
