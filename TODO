BUGs:

closing '}' after a THEN block appear in the _following_ BASIC line.

warnings about block ender tokens not matching the block starter appear even
in modes without indentation.

the "--list" mode complains about NEXTs because they do not match the "indentation"

the "--list" mode removes spaces from input

allow NEXT to close several blocks, if there are given more vars


TODOs:

keep :REMs at end of line at end of line

change GOTO <nothing> to GOTO 0

change "." numbers to "0"

actually _check_ var names given after NEXT

how tf can I indent something like this?
	if a then print 1:if b then print 2:else print 3
	a b	output
	0 0	3
	0 1	3
	1 0	13
	1 1	12
