"debasic" converts cbm basic programs to text while trying to make the
output human-readable.

If you want to be able to convert the output back to a working basic
program, then do not use this program. Use petcat from the VICE project
instead.


Syntax:
	debasic MODE INPUT
Output is written to stdout.


Possible modes:

"asis"
	Only convert from binary to text, just as LIST does.

"spaced"
	Insert spaces.

"indent"
	Insert spaces and output each statement on a separate line.
	Blocks are indicated via indentation.

"ref"
	As "indent", but line numbers are shown with reference counts.
	Un-referenced line numbers are suppressed.

"mb"
	As "ref", but also perform some substitutions:
		Array accesses are converted from () to [].
		"<>" and "><" are converted to "!=".
		"=" comparisons are converted to "==".
		Superfluous spaces, colons and LET are suppressed.

"py"
	As "mb", but makes the output look a bit more like Python code.
	Some special characters are replaced with uppercase letters:
		"get#3,a$,b%" becomes "get H3, aS, bX"

"c"
	As "mb", but makes the output look a bit more like C code.
	Some special characters are replaced with uppercase letters:
		"get#3,a$,b%" becomes "get(H3, aS, bX);"
