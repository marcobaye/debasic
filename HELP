"debasic" converts cbm basic programs to text while trying to make the
output human-readable.

If you want to be able to convert the output back to a working basic
program, then do not use this program. Use petcat from the VICE project
instead.


Syntax:
	debasic [MODE] INPUTFILE
Output is written to stdout.


Possible modes:

--list
	Only convert from binary to text, just as LIST does.

--spaced
	Insert spaces.

--indent
	Insert spaces and output each statement on a separate line.
	Blocks are indicated via indentation.

--ref
	As "--indent", but line numbers are shown with reference counts.
	Un-referenced line numbers are suppressed.

--std
	As "--ref", but also perform some substitutions:
		Array accesses are converted from () to [].
		"<>" and "><" are converted to "!=".
		"=" comparisons are converted to "==".
		Superfluous spaces, colons and LET are suppressed.
	This is the default mode.

--python
	As "--std", but makes the output look a bit more like Python code:
		"REM" becomes "#", "THEN" becomes ":", etc.
	Some special characters are replaced with uppercase letters:
		"#3,a$,b%" becomes "H3, aS, bX"

--c
	As "--std", but makes the output look a bit more like C code:
		"REM" becomes "//", "THEN" becomes "{", etc.
	Some special characters are replaced with uppercase letters:
		"#3,a$,b%" becomes "H3, aS, bX"
